# robot simulation

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Ma5a/pen/LYQoLNR](https://codepen.io/Ma5a/pen/LYQoLNR).

I coded this to experiment with movements and behaviour based on simple rules. Small robots move about the page, and tries to destroy and gain energy from weaker robots or robots that have stopped for charging. When there are no threats nearby, robots will charge, and when it meets certain conditions, multiplies.  When it gains too much energy, robots can sometimes explode. You can click on each robots to check their status and their activity logs.
